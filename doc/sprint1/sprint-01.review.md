> _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.
>
> _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.

## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

- When: 15/06/2023
- Where: Online

## Process - Reflection

(Optional) Short introduction

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

- 2 - 4 decisions.
- Ordered from most to least important.
- Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
- Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

* We believe our decision to conduct standup meetings once every two days was successful since it gave team members the time to report substantial work to the team. It allowed team members to seek help to clear blockers at the appropriate time.
* We believe our decision to decouple schemas(as opposed to using one large schema with sub-documents) helped team members develop features rapidly and independently.
* We believe our decision to note down action items after the end of each meeting helped team members keep track of the work they needed to do before the next meeting.
* Our "Industry-standard" channel in slack allowed team members to post widely accepted standards so that our code quality would meet industry standards and made it easier for us to be consistent.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

- 2 - 4 decisions.
- Ordered from most to least important.
- Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

* We did not agree on coding standards, conventions before we started working on our user stories. This lead to many last minute changes and confusion.
* We did not have a fixed meeting agenda before the meeting started. This caused our meetings to be unfocused and we wasted some time.
* We did not ensure that our branches had only the work for which it was created. This lead to more conflicts and confusing commit history.

#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

- Ordered from most to least important.
- Explain why you are making a change.

* We agree that everyone will do the work only relevant to the Jira linked to the git branch in that branch. All other changes should be made in separate branches. This will reduce the risk of unnecessary merge conflicts as well as ensuring a clean commit history.
* We agree to follow the practices posted in the "Industry-standard" channel and to post our findings there as well. This will make our code easier to read and help us maintain consistency.

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

- From most to least important.
- Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
- If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.

We completed the following user stories:

- â€‹As a registered user, I want a login page so that I can access my account using my login credentials.

- As a registered GOGO user, I want a dashboard which will show me events based on my interests so that I can find events I am interested in easily and in an expedient manner.

- As an unregistered user, I want to register on the GOGO website using my email address so that I can create, attend and/or view events.

- As a logged-in user, I want to edit my interests so that other users are aware of my latest interests.

- As a logged-in user, I want to add simple events on the website so that I can go to events with like-minded individuals.

- As a logged-in user, I want to edit my user biography so that other users get to read my latest details.

Please refer

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

- From most to least important.
- For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.  
  e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

- 2 - 4 items
- Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
- High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
- These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
- Can be related to product and/or process.
