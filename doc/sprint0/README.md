# GoGo   

---

GoGo is a website that facilitates connections between people seeking to engage in shared experiences.   
Additionally, it serves as a valuable tool for enterprises to acquire previously unattainable consumers.   
GoGo was built because many individuals encounter the same problem - the desire to attend certain events but lacking companionship for the experience.   
These individuals represent a consumer segment that businesses often miss out on capturing.   
GoGo resolves this issue by allowing one individual to reach out to others in order to invite them to a specific event created by a business.
