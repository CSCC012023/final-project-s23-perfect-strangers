#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

YOUR ANSWER GOES HERE ...

 * Short (2-5 min' read)
 * Start with a single sentence, high-level description of the product.
 * Be clear - Describe the problem you are solving in simple terms.
 * Be concrete. For example:
    * What are you planning to build? Is it a website, mobile app,
   browser extension, command-line app, etc.?      
    * When describing the problem/need, give concrete examples of common use cases.
 * Focus on *what* your product does, and avoid discussing *how* you're going to implement it.      
   For example: This is not the time or the place to talk about which programming language and/or framework you are planning to use.
 * **Feel free (and very much encouraged) to include useful diagrams, mock-ups and/or links**.

GOGO is a website that connects individuals who want to explore events and experiences together while providing a platform for businesses to expand their reach.

* From a consumer perspective, GOGO helps overcome the anxiety of attending events alone, making it easier to go beyond your comfort zone and create lasting memories with kindred spirits. In essence, our web application will enable users to post about events they are interested in, invite people with similar interests to accompany them to the event, and have an awesome event experience.

* From a business perspective, consumers often skip out on experiences due to not wanting to go to an event alone. For an event, there may be multiple unacquainted people facing the same problem. Just by connecting these people, businesses hosting the events can tap into an otherwise untapped userbase. Additionally, through giving special discounts to people who can invite a certain number of event companions, businesses are able to pack their events with a larger audience count.


#### Q2: Who are your target users? (2-3 personas)

YOUR ANSWER GOES HERE ...

 * Short (2-5 min' read max)
 * Be specific (e.g. )
 * You can create your personas as part of this Markdown file, or add a link to an external site (for example, [Xtensio](https://xtensio.com/user-persona/)), or add a pdf

 GOGO's target users can be broadly categorized into two:
 * Indiviuals who experience anxiety or discomfort attending events alone or are simply looking for people to go with. For example, 
 // TODO: Change sentence
 * Businesses hosting events that want to tap into a larger audience by connecting individuals who would otherwise skip out on experiences due to attending alone. For example, 

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

YOUR ANSWER GOES HERE ...

 * Short (2-5 min' read max)
 * We want you to "connect the dots" for us - Why does your product (as described in your answer to Q1) fits the needs of your users (as described in your answer to Q2)?
 * Explain the benefits of your product explicitly & clearly. For example:
    * Save users time (how much?)
    * Allow users to discover new information (which information? And, why couldn't they discover it before?)
    * Provide users with more accurate and/or informative data (what kind of data? Why is it useful to them?)


The alternatives that users use today to solve their problem include:
* MeetUp
Meetup allows one to post events/activities on the app and join groups of people who are interested in particular events/activities. However, it does not allow a user to connect with another user through event invitations, and have one-on-one interactions with them regarding the event. GoGo allows this one-one interaction between users enabling them to get acquainted better prior to the event. This is especially beneficial for someone who does not like group settings. Additionally, users of MeetUp have to wait for a group to be formed whereas on GoGo users can attend events as soon as at least two are ready to go to the event.


* EventBrite
EventBrite allows one to sign up for events going on around them. It also allows them to post their own events on the application. But it does not allow users to see potential people who would be interested in joining them at the event. Also, it does not allow one to interact with other users (who are interested in the event) through the app. GoGo solves this issue by showing us profiles of other users (which includes the person's interests) enabling us to invite these people to the event/activity we are interested in.

* Social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and even Tinder
Social media sites do not make the events/experience the center of focus in the user-user interaction. In social media platforms, users connect with others based on their personalities. But sometimes, we might not like the personality or quirks of a person but may enjoy their company greatly during a certain activity. By making the event/activity/experience the focus of the user-user interaction, GoGo allows users to meet with such people as well whose company they might enjoy only during the event/activity/experience.
The profiles of users are not validated in most social media sites (unlike GoGo) which makes them more prone to scams and less secure.

#### Q4: What does "DONE" means to your Team 
 * The whole team needs to agree as to what ”done” means for the features you will
   implement.
 * Definition of done applies to all userstories

----
We will consider a user story to be done when it has been programmed by the assigned team member and reviewed by two reviewers (assigned for that user story) from the team.


### Highlights

YOUR ANSWER GOES HERE ...

Specify 3 - 5 key decisions and/or insights that came up during your meetings
and/or collaborative process. Here are few questions that can guide you

 * Short (5 min' read max)
 * Decisions can be related to the product and/or the team process.
    * Mention which alternatives you were considering.
    * Present the arguments for each alternative.
    * Explain why the option you decided on makes the most sense for your team/product/users.
 * Essentially, we want to understand how (and why) you ended up with your current product plan.
 * How did you organise the team? Which tools did you use, if any?
 * How frequently did you meet?

Here are the key decisions and/or insights that came up during our meetings:

 * We decided to meet 3 times a week on zoom to discuss everyone's progress. An alternative was to meet in person. But zoom was chosen as most of our availabilities match up at night and an online meetup would be more appropriate at that time. Alongside, zoom enables screen sharing which is a more convenient way for a 6 person team to go over a team member's progress report. An argument for in person meeting would be that it allows team members to debug each other's problems faster. Hence, we also reserved a potential in person meet up time which would be used if a team member faces a significant problem (eg. a tricky bug).

 * We decided on making a web application for the product. An alternative was to make a Mobile App which would make accessing the product very convenient for the user. But a web app was chosen as its usage would not be limited to the MobileOS the user has.

 * We decided to use the MERN stack since the MERN stack is a widely popular tech stack with tons of tutorials and documentations that would enable us to get ramped-up quickly. Additionally, it has a strong developer community and a wealth of resources to solve commonly encountered issues during development. The MEAN stack was considered as an alternative but it uses AngularJs not React, the framework that we will learn in C01. By using MERN stack over MEAN, we are avoiding the overhead of learning a second framework and ensuring that we have adequate support and guidence from the teaching staff.
