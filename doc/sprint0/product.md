# GOGO/Perfect Strangers

#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

GOGO is a website that connects individuals who want to explore events and experiences together. Our platform helps users overcome the anxiety of attending events alone, making it easier to go beyond their comfort zone and create lasting memories with kindred spirits.

User can register on the app using their facebook, google account or create an account on GOGO using their email address. Every user agrees to verify their phone number and supply their date of birth and gender.

Users can create events on our website with a brief description of themselves, the type of people they want to go to the event with, along with a description of the event itself, including location, time, and entry fees(if any). Users can invite other users and/or invite applications to join the event. 

Through the search bar, users can search for events by name or type. Interested users can send the creator of the event a request to attend the event, which includes a description of themselves and why they want to attend it. The creator can either accept or decline the request. If they accept, the users can chat with each other to get to know each other better and work out other details including covering/spliting costs using the in-app payment mechanism.

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

YOUR ANSWER GOES HERE ...

 * Short (2-5 min' read max)
 * We want you to "connect the dots" for us - Why does your product (as described in your answer to Q1) fits the needs of your users (as described in your answer to Q2)?
 * Explain the benefits of your product explicitly & clearly. For example:
    * Save users time (how much?)
    * Allow users to discover new information (which information? And, why couldn't they discover it before?)
    * Provide users with more accurate and/or informative data (what kind of data? Why is it useful to them?)

Users of GOGO have the following benefits of using our webpage:
   * GOGO helps users overcome the anxiety of attending events alone by letting them publicly list the   events they want to attend, inviting other people to attend it with them for free.
   * They can make an informed choice by vetting the requesting individual's profile, along with the information submitted by them in the request.
   * Users of GOGO need to be registered with their phone numbers. Thanks to our phone number verification, they are guaranteed that users can be traced to their phone numbers.
   * They can chat with the user they want to go the event to further vet the individual.
   * We make splitting/covering costs easy by providing an in-app payment platform.

Social media apps like Facebook offer event listing but they do not have the phone number authentication that we provide. As a result, Social media apps are replete with scam bots. GOGO provides users safety and security. They also lack an request based acceptance system that we provide to users so that they can vet the individuals they choose to go to events with. In addition, they do not provide a payment mechanism.

Apps like Eventbrite focus on businesses and events with large audience without a vetting process, we focus on small, intimate gatherings between like-minded individuals. 

#### Q4: What does "DONE" means to your Team
